 qingqiu_federation.1.t:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from Sanbao difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"
 qingqiu_federation.1.a:0 "We must choose our path carefully"
 qingqiu_federation.2.t:0 "The Great Qingqiu Flood of 1862!"
 qingqiu_federation.2.d:0 "The Flood"
 qingqiu_federation.2.f:0 "Two months of rain, snow and sleet have battered the hinterland of Qingqiu, coating the Dongji Mountains in a thick blanket of snow. Now thunder dominates the sky along the mountains in an intense winter storm, bringing in an unusual warmth from the south. The culmination of this has resulted in a flood of monumental proportions, great waves of snow-melt washed down the down the valleys of the Dongji Mountains, flooding the fertile valley that lay across Qingqiu and Shangu Siwang, before finally reaching the streets of Jinhe, Yingzhou and Sanbao! With our agricultral heartland flooded under great tracts of water, telegraph poles deep underwater and our people suffering, it is clear that we must make quick and decisive, yet careful action to avoid a greater crisis. Wether or not we have reformed our nation, we must move forwards and stop the suffering of our people!"
 qingqiu_federation.2.a:0 "We must begin recovery immediately"
 qingqiu_federation.3.t:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.3.d:0 "Success: A Reformed Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"
 qingqiu_federation.3.a:0 "Our federation may live on for another century!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.t:0 "The State of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.4.d:0 "Success: The end of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.4.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, we have successfully curbed the influence of the states, making the system functionally obsolete! Finally our nation will be stable, we have the oportunity to liberalise and progress, finally the Qingqiuian people won't need to bend the knee to corrupt governors and endure thier backwards ways. Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.a:0 "We walk forwards into a new era, united as one!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.tt:0 "We can only hope that this is enough"
 #Flood Chain
 qingqiu_flood.1.t:0 "Swift Actions"
 qingqiu_flood.1.d:0 "With the valley flooded and our towns underwater, we must take action immediately!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.f:0 "The valley has been the most badly affected area of the entire country, with its large fields and pastures it's obvious that we cannot standby idly by whilst our people suffer! As of now, our farmers are struggling to stay afloat, we have recieved reports that some of them have been clinging to telegraph poles in order to stay above water, every day that passes will only result in more casualties. Reports have also come from towns in the valley regarding people stranded on rooftops with what little they have left, rescuing them would take time but result in a brief economic slowdown!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.a:0 "Rescue the farmers and reestablish supply routes to the towns!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.b:0 "Rescue the farmers and townspeople using merchant ships!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.c:0 "Reestablish supply routes to the towns in order to save the people!"
 qingqiu_flood.2.t:0 "The Matter of the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.d:0 "With the crisis situated in Sanbao, the question lingers; what to do about the other provinces?"
 qingqiu_flood.2.f:0 "Sanbao, the valley and the cities of the valley are the most affected, now the governers of the provinces turn their eyes to Sanbao, wondering what actions to take. Whilst we have recieved many telegraphs and letters of mourning and hope from our governors, we must give them a statement on how to move forwards. We already have several proposals, the most popular in Sanbao being to impose new taxes on the provinces, funneling money into Sanbao - and likely into corrupt bureaucrat's pockets too - to fund the recovery efforts. Alternatively, temporarily granting further autonomy to the provinces would mean that they can manage themselves and we can manage the flood recovery efforts. However we also have the option of not responding at all, obviously this would not be the ideal course of action, but what other choices do we have?"
 qingqiu_flood.2.a:0 "Impose new taxes on the provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.b:0 "Temporarily grant more autonomy to the provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.c:0 "Send no response! The status-quo can remain"
 qingqiu_flood.3.t:0 "The Matter of the rest of the country"
 qingqiu_flood.3.d:0 "With the crisis in Sanbao, the question lingers; how should the rest of the country support Sanbao in this crisis?"
 qingqiu_flood.3.f:0 "Sanbao, the valley and the cities of the valley are the most affected, now the rest of our nation turns its eyes to Sanbao, wondering what further actions we will take. Whilst we have recieved many telegraphs and letters of mourning and hope from local officials, we must give our people a statement on any further actions we take. We have several proposals, the most popular in our government being to temporarily impose a new tax to fund further recovory efforts, funneling money into Sanbao. Alternatively, a suggestion to establish the Qingqiu State Disaster Response Ministry has been suggested, whilst this would put a strain on our already dwindling resources, it will make sure that we never suffer as we have suffered over these past months by preventing any such disaster occuring in future! We also have the option of not taking any further action, as of now things are under control and we have the luxury of choice in this situation."
 qingqiu_flood.3.a:0 "Establish the Disaster Response Ministry and put it to action immediately!"
 qingqiu_flood.3.b:0 "Temporarily impose a new tax to raise more funds"
 qingqiu_flood.3.c:0 "We will endure with what we have already"
 qingqiu_flood.4.t:0 "The Matter of the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.4.d:0 "With the crisis situated in Sanbao, the question lingers; what to do about the other provinces?"
 qingqiu_flood.4.f:0 "People are worried that our government is still in the midst of reforms and we are not capable of sending any response to our governors! Xiazhou resident and prominent member of the Sanbao League, Yuji Iwasaki has gathered support to promote the idea that Xiazhou should become the new capital of the federation, this idea has been hotly debated in Sanbao however, yet in times like this, we will take any ideas and advice being offered. Likewise has the idea that we temporarily delegate more liberties to the provinces whilst we struggle to reach into the furthest corners of the provinces and our nation, whilst this would allow us to dedicate all our time and resources, it would mean a weakened grip on the federation for some time. Some members of our government have also suggested that we ultimately do nothing, for the Federation of Qingqiu will endure!"
 qingqiu_flood.4.a:0 "Delegate more power to the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.4.b:0 "Xiazhou shall be our new capital!"
 qingqiu_flood.4.c:0 "We are strong, the Federation will survive!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.t:0 "The Levees of Sanbao and the Valley"
 qingqiu_flood.5.d:0 "Our great system of canals and levees, whilst built to prevent diasters, has only come to prolong the presence of floodwaters! We must address this!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.f:0 "The complex and intricate system of irrigation channels, ditches, canals and rivers in the valley were built over the span of several centuries, they serve to both irrigate the large swathes of farmland, as well as mitigate any minor floods and surges. However now this dense system of waterways is only stifling our efforts! The canals are full of silt and irrigation ditches only let more water wash into vast crop feilds and pastures! We could break the levees to relieve the valley somewhat, however this would mean that we would need to take some time to rebuild them, likely affecting our agricultral throughput for a few years. Whilst it may be more expensive and more difficult, we could dig temporary drainage channels through the farmland in order to quickly flush out a large portion of the floodwaters. Of course, simply letting nature take its course is an option too, perhaps the flood waters will receed overtime?"
 qingqiu_flood.5.a:0 "Break the levees - they will provide the most relief!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.b:0 "We don't need to take action here"
 qingqiu_flood.5.c:0 "Dig drainage channels, we cannot let this water remain any longer!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.t:0 "Beginning the Reconstruction"
 qingqiu_flood.6.d:0 "Even now as people wade through water in the streets of Sanbao and towns of the valley, we must begin to rebuild"
 qingqiu_flood.6.f:0 "Having resources imported from the north and east and our funding secured, we can begin rebuilding from the ground up. Unfortunately we are only missing the labor, many people from all across the Valley and Sanbao are occupied with picking up the pieces and what little they have left, we have so few people that can work for us! We need workers, it seems that the obvious choice would be sending our soldiers in to help rebuild, they are well trained and perhaps the force that's the most dedicated to our country! Some members of our government have proposed putting our prisoner populace to use though, even if we must force them to work for us. The final realistic choice we have is recruiting farmers from the Valley to rebuild, starting with their towns, unfortunately this will likely slow down our agricultural industries."
 qingqiu_flood.6.a:0 "Put the prisoners to use, it's all they're good for!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.b:0 "Send in our soldiers, they are the best equipped for dealing with this!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.c:0 "Recruit the farmsers from the valley!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.t:0 "Fate of the Shantytowns"
 qingqiu_flood.7.d:0 "Shantytowns; the dwellings of people lowest on the social ladder, they must be addressed, for their sake!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.f:0 "Towns built out of nothing but scraps and what little spare materials could be found are filled with our poorest citizens, now with the floodwaters lapping at their haphazardly constructed doors, we cannot sit by any longer and let our-worst off people suffer like this! Currently we have two proposals - rebuild the towns on higher ground near the cities, or build new towns and relocate the shantytowners there instead. However, these both come at a price, one that perhaps may be too high for us, leaving us with little choice but to let the shantytowners fend for themselves..."
 qingqiu_flood.7.a:0 "Construct new homes for them in any space possible!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.b:0 "Relocate them to outside the city in new towns"
 qingqiu_flood.7.c:0 "Leave them to their fate - we have nothing to spare for them"
