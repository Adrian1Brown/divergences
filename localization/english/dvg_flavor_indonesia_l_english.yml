 dvg_polynesia.1.t: "The Tui Tonga Empire"
 dvg_polynesia.1.d: "Despite its attempts to become the unopposed hegemonic power of the Pacific Islands since the 10th century, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Empire is largely unknown outside of the region."
 dvg_polynesia.1.f: "Still, this humble yet mighty nation gets by from being a stopping point for ships trying to cross the Pacific, whether they be merchants going between Zhourao and Qingqiu, European explorers hoping to 'discover' and claim new lands, or missionaries converting us to their religion through the education they provide. For much of our history, we have been an observer nation to these developments in the outside world. Of course, with all this observing comes knowledge that surely we can put to good use!"
 dvg_polynesia.1.a: "Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time!"
