 #cape recommends the moderate
 dvg_burgundy.100.t: "Cape Recommends the Moderate"
 dvg_burgundy.100.d: "The colonial government of the Cape has requested that the interim Governor, Gillebert Pierlot, be officially granted the title of Governor."
 dvg_burgundy.100.f: "Pierlot has proven himself to be a competent administrator. Instituting a 'government from afar' policy towards the Geus and native Africans; affording them a generous degree of autonomy. He believes that giving these communities nothing to resist will eventually result in them returning to work and engaging with the Burgundian economy."

 dvg_burgundy.100.b: "Reject him"

 dvg_burgundy.101.t: "Cape Recommends the Militarist"
 dvg_burgundy.101.d: "The colonial government of the Cape has requested that the interim Governor, Gillebert Pierlot, be relieved of his position in favour of an experienced general."
 dvg_burgundy.101.f: "Commander Regnault Courvoisier is a prime military condidate to fill the Governorship. He advocates for swift and violent reprisals against the rebellious Geuzen people, and aggresive settler colonisation to secure Burgundian control. Having already drawn up plans to recapture Ylnerdam from Aloysius, he is the favoured choice among hardliners in the Burgundian court."
 dvg_burgundy.101.a: "Accept him"
