  dvg_bali.1.t: "The United Kingdom of Bali"
 dvg_bali.1.d: "Centuries have passed following the fall of the Majapahit Empire, yet some political leaders living in its former territory (known as the Nusantara) are still nostalgic for its legacy of uniting the indies. One of these leaders is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], who has become the embodiment of the Balinese kingdoms uniting."
 dvg_bali.1.f: "Just like the old empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to maintain Hinduism as the state religion and thus sits alone in doing so being surrounded by a sea of sultanates and colonial powers. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] difficult road ahead of it if it wants to be taken seriously as the re-uniter of the Nusantara. \n \n Seeing the success in uniting Bali and the Sunda Islands, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty hopes to do the same with the rest of the East Indies. However, even many of our leader's loyal supporters consider this idea far-fetched. Outmanned by the other regional powers and technologically behind the Europeans, our leader still believes such ambitions are possible."
