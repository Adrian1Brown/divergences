 dvg_nuweflander.1.f: "When [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetName] raised taxes during the German wars, many landowners rose up in revolt and forced out the meager [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetAdjective] garrison. This group of landowners, most of them Burgundian quickly formed a council known as the Grondraad to govern the new country. Angered by the Grondraad's continued discrimination against the Geuzen population, a group of artisans, shopkeepers and merchants, known as the Winkeliers, rose up, forcing the Grondraad to flee to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_OPS').GetName]  before establishing a new republic."

 dvg_nuweflander.2.t: "Opstalia moves on Reurveld"
 dvg_nuweflander.2.d: "Nestled in the mountains West of Niew Amsterdam there is a settlement, Reurveld, that has become quite prosperous over the last decade."
 dvg_nuweflander.2.f: "Troops have been dispached from Dierickstadt to assert control over the settlement. While this is an act of aggression, the settlement is not under our protection, and we owe them no defence. Nevertheless, having [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_OPS').GetName] moving their border closer to us has aroused fears over our national security, should we intervene on Reurveld's behalf?" 
 dvg_nuweflander.2.a: "Let them have it"
 dvg_nuweflander.2.b: "Intercept their troops"
